# NES Bundler

**Transform your NES-game into a single executable targeting your favourite OS!**

Did you make a NES-game but none of your friends own a Nintendo? Don't worry.  
Put your ROM and configuration in NES Bundler and build for Mac, Windows or Linux.  
What you get is a single executable with
* Simple UI for settings (Show and hide with ESC).
* Re-mappable Keyboard and Gamepad input (you bundle your default mappings).
* Save/Restore state (F1 = Save, F2 = Load).
* Netplay! (Optional feature, can be disabled if not wanted).

## Bundling

To create a bundle you first need to [configure it](config/README.md) with your ROM and a build configuration.  
After that you can either ship your game with the configuration inside the executable or next to it.
### Next to it (the easy way)

* Download the [binary of your choice](https://github.com/tedsteen/nes-bundler/releases/)
* Run it and select the directory with your bundle (`config.yaml` and `rom.nes`)
* This will result in `bundle.zip` being placed next to the executable which will load automatically on startup.

### Inside it (the not so easy way)

* [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
* Make sure your bundle configuration is in the config directory.
* Build with the `static-bundle`-feature enabled `cargo build --release --features static-bundle`. Enable the `netplay`-feature for Netplay.
* This will result in an executable with the bundle embedded inside of it.

## Limitations

* It's built on [rusticnes-core](https://github.com/zeta0134/rusticnes-core) so it's limited to what that can emulate (f.ex no PAL).
* Save/load state and thus netplay is currently working for mappers nrom, mmc1, mmc3, uxrom, axrom, bnrom, cnrom, gxrom and ines31.  
  If you want to contribute, please implement save/load for a mapper [over here](https://github.com/tedsteen/rusticnes-core-for-nes-bundler/blob/master/src/mmc/mapper.rs#L43-L45).
