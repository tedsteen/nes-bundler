# Configure your bundle

In order to build your bundle you need two files.  

* A `config.yaml` containing the build configuration.
* A `nes.rom` with your game.

## Build configuration

A file named `config.yaml` looking something like this:
```yaml
# For all the gory details see the `BuildConfiguration`-struct in the source.

# The title of the window...
window_title: "My Awesome Game!"

# This will be the default settings for the bundle.
default_settings:
    audio:
        latency: 10 #in ms
        volume: 100 #in %
    input:
        # Two ids that corresponds to the selected input mapping configuration of P1 and P2. Should only be keyboard mappings as they're guaranteed to be available.
        selected:
            - 00-keyboard-1
            - 00-keyboard-2
        # A list of input mapping configurations. For more key mappings see https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/event/enum.VirtualKeyCode.html.
        # To add a gamepad configuration use the kind `Gamepad` and id `01-gamepad-0` for the first gamepad that connects, `01-gamepad-1` for the second and so on.
        configurations:
            00-keyboard-1:
                id: 00-keyboard-1
                name: "âŒ¨ Keyboard 1"
                kind: !Keyboard

            01-gamepad-0:
                id: 01-gamepad-0
                name: "ðŸŽ® Gamepad"
                kind: !Gamepad

## ROM-file

A file named `rom.nes` containing your actual game.  
You can try it out with the included `demo.nes`.
