# Configure your bundle

This directory has a pre-configured bundle for reference.  
If you want to build a proper bundle you also need to dig into the individual subdirectories here to customise installer graphics, icons etc.

Here is a breakdown of what can be customised
* [config.yaml](config.yaml) - the main configuration
* [rom.nes](rom.nes) - your game
* [netplay-rom.nes](netplay-rom.nes) - optional custom Netplay ROM. This will enable a different player experience for netplayers, if f.ex in a netplay session you do not want to present the player with the one player option you can bake a ROM that defaults to two players

The rest is only needed for a proper bundle
* [Linux icon](linux/icon_256x256.png)
* [Mac icon set](macos/bundle.iconset/)
* [Windows program and window icon](windows/icon_256x256.ico)
* [Windows installer details](windows/wix/) (banner.bmp, dialog.bmp and licence.rtf)

# Total control
If you want to build your own binaries with your own certificates you would have to fork this repository, provide some github secrets and finally run the `release.sh`-script to trigger a build in your fork.

## Signing the binaries
The Github action build scripts will sign the binaries. To do that they need a couple of secrets.
Currently the macOS bundles and the windows binaries is digitally signed.

### Secrets needed to sign the macOS bundle

#### BUNDLE_APPLE_TEAM_ID
Your Apple developer Team ID
#### BUNDLE_APPLE_USER
Your Apple ID
#### BUNDLE_APPLE_APP_PASSWORD
App specific password, create it under your account [here](https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage)

#### BUILD_PROVISION_PROFILE_BASE64
A base64 encoded provision profile.  
Create it [here](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list) and then base64 encode it `base64 -i "mygame.provisionprofile" | pbcopy`

#### BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64
A base64 encoded build certificate.  
[Here's a guide](https://support.magplus.com/hc/en-us/articles/203808748-iOS-Creating-a-Distribution-Certificate-and-p12-File) on how to create it.  
Remember the password as you need it for the next secret.  
When you have the p12-file base 64 encode it `base64 -i "certificate.p12" | pbcopy`

#### P12_PASSWORD
The password you created for the build certificate in the previous step.

#### CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY
The code sign identity for the build certificate.  
Run `xcrun security find-identity -v -p codesigning` to find it

### Secrets needed to sign the Windows binaries

First [read this](https://melatonin.dev/blog/how-to-code-sign-windows-installers-with-an-ev-cert-on-github-actions/)
And if you manage to get through all that you should have the five following variables :)
* AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URI
* AZURE_CLIENT_ID
* AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
* AZURE_CERT_NAME
* AZURE_TENANT_ID
